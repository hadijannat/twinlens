# Test Fixtures

This directory contains sample AASX files for testing.

## Obtaining Test Files

Download sample AASX files from:
- [IDTA Sample Files](https://github.com/admin-shell-io/aas-specs-aasx)
- [AASX Package Explorer Examples](https://github.com/eclipse-aaspe/package-explorer)

Place `.aasx` files in this directory for manual testing.

## Note

The unit tests in `tests/unit/` create synthetic AASX files programmatically,
so no fixture files are required for automated testing.
